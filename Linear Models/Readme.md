## Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful learning algorithm to maximize the margin among class variables. This margin (alias: support vector) represents the distance of the separating hyperplanes (alias: decision boundary).

## Why Support Vector Machine

The rationale to have decision boundaries with large margin is to separate positive and negative hyperplanes with adjustable bias-variance proportion. The goal is to separate so that negative samples would fall under negative hyperplane and positive samples would fall under positive hyperplane.
